To approach this task of binning Smotifs based on structural similarity using RMSD and total contacts, I'll need to ask you some questions to better understand the problem and constraints. Here are my questions:

1. What is the acceptable RMSD threshold you're considering for two Smotifs to be considered structurally similar?
A: Two Angstroms.

2.How much variation in total contacts would you allow for Smotifs to be considered similar? For example, would you consider a percentage difference or an absolute difference?
A: I would consider a percentage difference of 20% or less to be acceptable.
3. Are you open to using a clustering algorithm, or do you prefer a more deterministic binning approach?
A: I am open to using a deterministic binning approach.
4. How do you want to handle the uneven number of atoms in the RMSD calculation? Should we consider only the common atoms, or is there a specific alignment strategy you prefer?
A: I would prefer an apporach where a sliding window is used to align the residues in the two Smotifs. Sequence information shall not be used.
5. Are there any other structural features besides RMSD and total contacts that you think might be relevant for binning?
A: No, I think RMSD and total contacts are the most relevant features for binning.

6. What's the approximate size of your dataset (number of Smotifs)?
A: I have around 40000-80000 Smotifs in my dataset.

7. Do you have any preference for the number of bins or the size of bins?
A. No, I do not have any preference for the number of bins or the size of bins.

8. Are you interested in a hierarchical approach where you first bin by one criterion and then sub-bin by another, or do you prefer a simultaneous consideration of both RMSD and total contacts?
A: I am interested in a hierarchical approach where I first bin by one criterion and then sub-bin by another.

9.How important is computational efficiency for this binning process?
A: Computational efficiency is not important.

10. Do you have any specific requirements for handling outliers or unusual Smotifs that don't fit well into any bin?
A: I would like to identify and label outliers separately from the main bins.
